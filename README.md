***LOAD BALANCING IN NETWORK OF SERVERS***


In this practical world almost all the systems are in the form of a network. Managing these networks is quite challenging. One of such real-world networks is the university computer system where the computers are the nodes and they form the network and are assigned with some jobs. So, allocating the upcoming jobs to the existing system by managing their availability is the challenge. This problem is termed as the Load Balancing in the network server. To solve this problem, we have implemented the BFS algorithm in our work.
